<h1>How to setup the VPN client</h1>

<ul>
	<li>First, click on the power icon to download the correct app for your specific platform. If none of the links work, download and install manually from <a href="https://nextcloud.mildlybrewed.com/s/XHeeZfa2RfxbexM">here</a>.</li>
	<li>On Andriod/iOS, scan the QR code to add a profile. Make sure to activate the VPN mode. Use the per-app proxy settings to allow apps like Taobao to bypass the VPN.</li>
	<li>On Windows, find the installation folder, right-click Hiddify.exe and select Properties -> Compatibility, then check off 'Run as Administrator'. To add a profile, copy the shared link and import from clipboard. Make sure to use VPN mode as well.</li>
	<li>For MacOS, it is possible but very difficult, contact me personally.</li>
</ul>
